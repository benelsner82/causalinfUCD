    "text": "About Causal Inference\nCausal questions are everywhere in the social sciences. We strive to understand the impact of educational interventions on student outcomes, the effectiveness of public health campaigns in reducing disease rates, the influence of economic policies on employment rates, the causal factors driving voter behavior and electoral outcomes, or the effects of media framing on public opinion and political decision-making. Unlike in the sciences, however, conducting randomised experiments to answer these questions is often impractical or unethical. This is where causal inference becomes a highly useful toolbox. Causal inference allows us to estimate causal effects even in the absence of randomised experiments. It provides us with rigorous methods to untangle cause-and-effect relationships from observational data, enabling us to make informed decisions , evaluate policies, and guide evidence-based policymaking."

    "text": "Who Can Take this Module?\nThis is a M.Sc course offered by the UCD School of Economics. The techniques taught in this course have applications across many disciplines such as sociology, political science, education, social policy, health policy, or epidemiology. Students should have a good knowledge of multivariate regression and panel regressions. In addition, they should be able to write code with R. We will do a re-cap of regression early in the course, but we do not have time to teach R from scratch."

    "text": "My name is Ben Elsner and I‚Äôm looking forward to teaching this course Causal Inference and Policy Evaluation at UCD. I‚Äôm originally from Germany, where I grew up in the beautiful city of Regensburg. I have been living in Ireland on and off since 2008. I got a PhD in economics from Trinity College Dublin in 2012 and afterwards worked as a researcher and policy adviser at the Institute of Labor Economics (IZA) in Bonn/Germany. In 2018, I returned to Ireland and ‚Äúchanged sides‚Äù by joining UCD. I‚Äôm an applied microeconomist an my research mainly deals with the impact of migration on sending and receiving countries. I have also recently taken a great interest in the impact of pollution on human capital formation and decision-making and am currently working on some projects in this field. You can learn more about my work on my website www.benjaminelsner.com.\nI am passionate about teaching econometrics and data analytics because it equips students with a highly useful toolbox that allows them to go out into the world and do their own research. I am particularly excited about this new course Causal Inference and Policy Evaluation (launched in spring 2024) because it is truly interdisciplinary: its material appeals to scholars in a large number of disciplines such as economics, political science, sociology, health policy, social work, education and everything in between.\nWhen I don‚Äôt do research or teach, I enjoy cooking (especially bbq), reading, and playing piano."

Students will get one letter grade in the end.\n\nFinal exam\nThe final exam will take place in the RDS or on campus during the exam period. It‚Äôs a two-hour closed book exam. Students cannot bring notes. Usually, there is a study week between the last teaching week and the exam period. The exam period lasts two weeks. The exam timetable is set by the UCD exam office. We can accommodate special arrangements (for example for students with disabilities), but we cannot accommodate requests to sit an exam on a different date or online.\n\n\nAssignments\nWe will have two empirical assignments that require students to analyse a dataset, visualise content, and write up their results. The first assignment will be given around week 4; the second assignment will be given around week 9 (assuming a 14-week term).\n\n\nAssessment Policies\n\nAI Policy I am a firm believer in AI as a helpful tool for our work, and I encourage students to use it. I see two major uses for the assignments: helping with coding (debugging, suggesting more efficient solutions), and language editing. If you use AI for your assignment, please add an AI statement at the beginning and explain very briefly what you used it for. You will not lose points if you use AI; I am just curious what students used it for. Also, be careful when using AI: it can produce nonsense results, and for those you will lose a lot of points.\nLate submission policy: assignments have to be submitted by the deadline. UCD‚Äôs late submission policy does not apply. If you know that you will not be able to submit an assignment on time, please let me know as soon as possible.\nPlagiarism policy: UCD‚Äôs Student Plagiarism Policy applies. I reserve the right to use a plagiarism checker.\n\n\n\nGrade Scale\nFor all assessments, I will apply the alternative linear grade scale; the pass mark is 40%:\n\n\n\nGrades\nLower %\nUpper %\n\n\n\n\nA+\n‚â•95\n100\n\n\nA\n‚â•90\n&lt;95\n\n\nA-\n‚â•85\n&lt;90\n\n\nB+\n‚â•80\n&lt;85\n\n\nB\n‚â•75\n&lt;80\n\n\nB-\n‚â•70\n&lt;75\n\n\nC+\n‚â•65\n&lt;70\n\n\nC\n‚â•60\n&lt;65\n\n\nC-\n‚â•55\n&lt;60\n\n\nD+\n‚â•50\n&lt;55\n\n\nD\n‚â•45\n&lt;50\n\n\nD-\n‚â•40\n&lt;45\n\n\nE+\n‚â•35\n&lt;40\n\n\nE\n‚â•30\n&lt;35\n\n\nE-\n‚â•25\n&lt;30\n\n\nF+\n‚â•20\n&lt;25\n\n\nF\n‚â•15\n&lt;20\n\n\nF-\n‚â•10\n&lt;15\n\n\nG+\n‚â•5\n&lt;10\n\n\nG\n‚â•0.02\n&lt;5\n\n\nG-\n‚â•0.01\n&lt;0.02\n\n\nNM\n0\n&lt;0.01\n\n\nABS\nNo work submitted / absent"

    "text": "üñ•Ô∏è Software\nTL/DR; you will need:\n\nR and R Studio; please download and install these at the start of the course.\nA word processor: MS Word is ok but I strongly recommend Quarto.\nGithub: please make an account and download Github Desktop\n\n\nStatistical Software\nAll assignments and labs will be done with R. Using R comes with lots of advantages: it is a very flexible object-oriented programming language with a huge comparative advantage in data analytics. It is free, which is great, and it has excellent AI support through ChatGPT and Github Copilot.\nTo work with R, you need to install R itself (link here) and a user interface. As a user interface, I recommend RStudio (link here), which is very user friendly and has been optimised for use with R. RStudio Desktop is free and is sufficient for all our applications. An alternative is Visual Studio Code (link here), which is also great.\n\n\nWord processing\nFor writing your assignments, you can use any word processing software. However, I strongly recommend that you learn to use markdown software. Markdown allows for an integrated workflow of data cleaning, exploration, visualisation and write-up. It can handle inputs from many programming languages (R, Python, SQL, Julia, etc) and markdown languages (R markdown, html, LaTeX, etc) and create nice-looking outputs in pdf, html, doc, or ppt format. So you can create presentation slides, websites, academic papers, CVs, and many more outputs with markdown. For example, this website was made with a markdown software, as were the lecture slides and the tutorial sheets. If you are interested in a career in data science or data analytics, you will have to learn to use markdown.\nSounds daunting? The basics are actually quite easy to learn. I highly recommend Quarto, which can be used from within RStudio or VSCode.\n\n\nVersion Control\nVersion control is a crucial tool for anyone writing software. And, yes, when you do empirical work you do write software. Version controls allows efficient management of project files, collaboration with teammates, and tracking of changes over time. With version control, you can maintain different versions of your work, experiment, and easily revert if needed. It promotes transparency by recording every modification, which is valuable when working on complex projects. Additionally, it enables seamless collaboration and merging of changes.\nIn your assignments you will be asked to show proof that you use version control. The main version control system is Github, which offers free accounts. I particularly recommend Github Desktop, a very user-friendly interface for Github. I will provide a brief introduction to Github."

The best you can do is learn the basics, get started with a project and learn by doing. And then practice, practice, practice.\nThere are almost endless resources on R on the web. Here are some resources I recommend:\n\nVideos\n\nNick Huntington-Klein has excellent videos on R for econometrics and many other topics.\nAlbert Rapp‚Äôs website and YouTube channel is a treasure trove for tips and tricks with R, especially for data wrangling, visualisation, and outputs with Quarto.\n\n\n\nTextbooks and websites\n\nHere is a free e-book with an introduction to base R. R has gotten a lot more user friendly with the introduction of tidyverse. However, if you want to become proficient in R, knowing base R is very helpful.\nR for Data Science by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund is THE standard textbook for working with tidyverse.\nFor econometrics, I recommend two e-books: 1) Introduction to Econometrics with R, an introductory e-book based on the Stock & Watson textbook, created by Christoph Hanck, Martin Arnold, Alexander Gerber, and Martin Schmelzer. 2) Introduction to Econometrics with R, a free e-book by a team of professors from Sciences Po (Florian Oswald, Vincent Viers, Jean-Marc Robin, Pierre Villedieu, Gustave Kenedi). The book combines everything you need: an introduction to R, econometric theory, coding examples, etc.\nThe R Graph Gallery by Yan Holtz provides examples (visual and code) for pretty much any graph type under the sun.\nTelling Stories with Data by Rohan Alexander is a free e-book aimed at data scientists. It offers lots of excellent examples about workflows, exploratory analysis, modeling and applications.\nAllison Horst‚Äôs page on data wrangling with dplyr is excellent. Come for the coding, stay for the penguin illustrations.\nR is great for text analysis. You can learn tidytext in this excellent tutorial by Julia Silge. A more comprehensive package on text analysis is Quanteda, which has been co-written and is co-maintained by Stefan M√ºller. Stefan is also based at UCD and does very cool work at the intersection of political science and data science. See here for an example.\nGrant McDermott‚Äôs materials on Data Science for Economists have lots of interesting material on workflow, processing of large data (high-performance computing, Spark, Docker), and database management.\nJon Hersh‚Äôs course on Machine Learning for Economistscovers the basics of machine learning in a very intuitive way."
