## DiD is a Quasi-Experimental Design

\brf{Some units get treated, some don't}... we've heard that before

\vfill
\brf{What's different about difference-in-differences?}

- **Treatment assignment** does **NOT** need to be as good as **random**
- The **TREND in outcomes** of the control group is a good **counterfactual** for the trend of the treated group

\vfill
DiD is arguably one of the \brf{most popular designs in empirical economics}




## Historical DiD Example: The Cholera Hypothesis

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.65\textwidth}
19th century: Cholera was a major disease in Europe

\vspace{1cm}

\brf{Dominant hypothesis}: Cholera is **transmitted through the air**

\brf{John Snow in 1854}: Cholera is **transmitted through water**

## The Cholera Hypothesis

Snow's theory: \brf{Cholera is transmitted through water}

- People drink contaminated water that contains the cholera bacterium
- The bacterium enters the digestive system and causes cholera
- Through vomiting and diarrhea, the bacterium is excreted and contaminates the water supply further

\vfill
**Some observations**:

- Sailors got sick when they went on land but not when staying docked
- Cholera was more prevalent in poor areas with bad hygiene
- Some apartment blocks were affected, other neighbouring ones not


## The Cholera Hypothesis

\brf{How could Snow test his theory?}

- Mind you: experiments were only established in 1935 by Fisher as a means to prove causality
- And you couldn't run an experiment (drink from the Thames if heads, from another source if tails)

\vfill

\brf{Snow's research design}

- Some areas in London had their water supply from the Thames
- Others had their water supply from other sources
- Problem: areas were different in many ways


## Snow's Research Design

\brf{Different boroughs in London} had different \brf{water supplies, all from the Thames}

\vfill

\brf{But: in 1849 the Lambeth Water Company switched to a new water source upstream}

- This turned out to be cleaner and not contaminated cholera
- The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company did not switch

\vfill
\brf{Did cholera cases decline in Lambeth after the switch relative to Southwark and Vauxhall?}



## Lambeth vs. Southwark and Vauxhall Water Supply

## John Snow's Data

Much of the data on water suppliers was hand-collected (!) by Snow

\vfill
\brf{Cholera deaths per 10,000 households} in the mid-1850s
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
\textbf{Company Name} & \textbf{1849} & \textbf{1854} \\
& Before Switch & After Switch \\
\hline
Southwark and Vauxhall & 135 & 147 \\
Lambeth & 85 & 19 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\vfill
\brf{Things to note}

- There were **more deaths in both years in Southwark and Vauxhall**
- **Death rates in Lambeth dropped dramatically** after the switch
- Death rates in Southwark and Vauxhall stayed roughly the same

## John Snow Discovered Difference-in-Differences

\brf{Difference 1}: Lambeth vs. Southwark and Vauxhall

- Solid blue vs red line: differences in cholera deaths between the two areas


\vfill

\brf{Difference 2}: Before vs. after the switch

- Dotted blue line: projects the trend in Lambeth if the switch had not happened
- This is just the trend of Southwark and Vauxhall

\vfill
\brf{Difference-in-differences}: The difference between the solid and dotted blue line

- relative to the counterfactual, the switch reduced cholera deaths by 78 per 10,000 households



## John Snow Discovered Difference-in-Differences

\begin{tabular}{lcc|c}
\hline
\textbf{Company Name} & \textbf{1849} & \textbf{1854} & \textbf{Difference 2} \\
& Before Switch & After Switch \\
\hline
Southwark and Vauxhall & 135 & 147 & \textcolor{darkgreen}{+12}\\
Lambeth & 85 & 19 & \textcolor{red}{-66} \\
\hline
\textbf{Difference 1} & \textcolor{red}{-50} & \textcolor{red}{-128} & \textcolor{red}{-78}\\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\vfill

The difference-in-differences is 78 cholera deaths per 10,000 households
