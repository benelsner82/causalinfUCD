## Fixed Effects

Start with a regression:

$$ Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i} + u_{i} $$
\vfill
If there are unobserved confounders, we have the problem that $E[u_i|X_i] \neq 0$

\vfill
If we could \brf{observe these confounders}, we could include them in the regression

$$ Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i} +  \boldsymbol{S_{i}'\delta} + u_{i} $$
If $S_{i}$ includes all confounders, $E[u_i|X_i, \boldsymbol{S_i}]=0$ holds and we have an unbiased and consistent estimator for $\beta_1$.


## Fixed Effects: Controlling for Unobservables

\brf{Problem}: We usually can't observe all confounders

\vfill 
\brf{Fixed effects} allow us to \brf{control for (some) unobserved and observed confounders}

\vfill
\brf{What we need:}

- **Panel data**: multiple observations per unit
- or **Grouped data**: multiple units in each group



## Fixed Effects with Panel Data

\brf{Panel data} is data with multiple observations per unit $i$

$$ Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + u_{it} $$
\vfill

Now \brf{add unit fixed effects}:

$$ Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \alpha_i + u_{it} $$

The fixed effects $\alpha_i$ can be viewed as \brf{separate dummies for each unit $i$}

## What Fixed Effects Do

$$ Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \alpha_i + u_{it} $$

The fixed effects $\alpha_i$ isolate the \brf{within-unit variation in $Y_{it}$ and $X_{it}$}

\vfill

Suppose $i$ are countries and $t$ are years. \brf{Interpretation of $\beta_1$}:

- If $X_{it}$ goes up in a given country, how does $Y_{it}$ change within the same country?
- So $\beta_1$ measures the \brf{average within-country effect} of $X_{it}$ on $Y_{it}$

\vfill

The fixed effects $\alpha_i$ \brf{control for all time-invariant observables AND unobservables}


## Fixed Effects: Example

We will now go through a simple example: \brf{crime rates and police presence in cities}
\begin{itemize}
\item Here, a \textit{group} is a city
\item There is \textit{within-city variation} in crime rates and police presence \textit{over time}
\item This is the classic use of \textit{fixed effects with panel data}
\end{itemize}

\vfill
Data are (to some extent) made up for illustration purposes


## Fixed Effects: Example

\brf{Causal relationship of interest}
\begin{equation*}
    \mbox{crime}_{i}=\alpha + \beta \mbox{ police presence}_{i} + u_i
\end{equation*}

\vfill

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Year} & \textbf{Murder rate} & \textbf{Police presence} \\
\hline
Baltimore  & 2009 & 55.4 & 42  \\
Albuquerque & 2009 & 7.7 & 28 \\
New York & 2009 & 4.1 & 30 \\
Pittsburgh & 2009 &  18.6 & 33 \\
San Francisco & 2009 & 6.1 & 20 \\
Detroit & 2009 & 43.8 &  31  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}


## The Cross-sectional Relationship is Positive...


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph1.png"))
```


## Fixed Effect Regressions

\brf{Logic of Fixed Effect Regressions}: exploit \textbf{variation within subjects over time}
\vfill

In our case: how does the \textbf{murder rate in a city change} when \underline{in the same city} the police presence increases by 1 unit?
\vfill
\textbf{Advantage:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{fixed city characteristics} are \textbf{held constant}
  \item And as such many determinants why Baltimore has a higher crime rate \textit{and} police presence than San Francisco
  \item We circumvent an important \textit{selection problem} $\Rightarrow$ eliminates (or reduces) \textbf{omitted variable bias}
\end{itemize}



## Now Suppose You Have Panel Data

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Year} & \textbf{Murder rate} & \textbf{Police presence} \\
\hline
Baltimore  & 2009 & 55.4 & 42  \\
Baltimore  & 2012 & 47.4 & 49  \\
\hline
Albuquerque & 2009 & 7.7 & 28 \\
Albuquerque & 2012 & 14.2 & 23 \\
\hline
New York & 2009 & 4.1 & 30 \\
New York & 2012 & 3.8 & 36 \\
\hline
Pittsburgh & 2009 &  18.6 & 33 \\
Pittsburgh & 2012 &  12.6 & 38 \\
\hline
San Francisco & 2009 & 6.1 & 20 \\
San Francisco & 2012 & 7.4 & 28 \\
\hline
Detroit & 2009 & 43.8 &  31  \\
Detroit & 2012 & 47.6 &  28  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\scriptsize{Note: data are fictitious}


## Cross-sectional Relationship in Panel Data: Still Positive


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph2.png"))
```


## In each year we have a positive association


```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph3.png"))
```

## Now look at within-city changes

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph4.png"))
```


## Fixed Effect Regressions


A \textbf{Fixed Effect Regressions} only relies on the \textbf{within-variation}


\begin{equation*}
    y_{it} = \beta x_{it} + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation*}    
\vfill
The \textbf{between-variation} will be netted out
\vfill
At the core of the FE regression lies a \textbf{within-transformation}
\begin{equation*}
    y_{it}-\overline{y}_i = \beta(x_{it}-\overline{x}_i) + \varepsilon_{it} - \varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation*}
\vfill
Takes from each variable the \textbf{deviation from the mean}



## Within-transformation of $Y$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph5.png"))
```

## Within-transformation of $X$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph6.png"))
```


## Within-transformation of $X$ and $Y$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph7.png"))
```

## The within-effects in each city

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph8.png"))
```


## Average within-effect: NEGATIVE!

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph9.png"))
```


## Summary of the example

The \textbf{cross-sectional relationship} between police presence and crime rates is \textbf{positive}

- This is \textbf{between-city variation}
- It is driven by \textbf{differences in city characteristics}
- More crime-prone cities choose to hire more police officers...

\vfill

We can learn a lot from \textbf{within-city variation}

- The city fixed effects \textbf{eliminate all time-invariant differences between cities}
- They isolate the \textbf{within-city variation} in \textbf{all variables}
- The \textbf{within-effect} of police presence on crime rates is \textbf{negative}

\vfill
\brf{Interpretation:} if within a city the police presence goes up by 1 unit, the crime rate goes down by $\beta$ units

## Another way to look at fixed effects

The fixed effects \brf{split the data into many units} -- here a unit is a city

\vfill
A \brf{fixed effect regression performs two tasks} at the same time:

1. it estimates the effect of X on Y within each unit
2. it averages these effects across all units


## Multiple units and time periods

It is common to have \brf{panel data with many units and many time periods}

- Example: 50 US states over 20 years

\vfill
We often use \brf{two-way fixed effects}:

- Unit fixed effects ($\delta_i$) absorb all time-invariant differences between units
- Time fixed effects ($\delta_t$) absorb all time trends that are common to all units

\vfill
The \brf{regression equation is then}

$$ Y_{it} = \beta X_{it} + \delta_i + \delta_t + u_{it} $$


## Fixed Effects with Grouped Data

\brf{Grouped data} is data with multiple units $i=1,\dots,N$ which belong to distinct groups $g=1,\dots,G$.

\vfill
\brf{Example:} students in schools, workers in firms, patients in hospitals

\vfill 
\brf{Classic case}: stratified experiments in within schools

- It is not random who goes to which school
- But within schools, treatment assignment is random

\vfill
To estimate the treatment effect, we can use \brf{fixed effects for groups}

\begin{equation*}
    Y_{ig} = \beta X_{ig} + \alpha_g + u_{ig}
\end{equation*}



## Implementation of Fixed Effects Regressions in R

First of all, you need to \brf{have panel data in "long form"}

- Each \textbf{row} is an observation for a unit at a certain time

\small

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Year} & \textbf{Murder rate} & \textbf{Police presence} \\
\hline
Baltimore  & 2009 & 55.4 & 42  \\
Baltimore  & 2012 & 47.4 & 49  \\
\hline
Albuquerque & 2009 & 7.7 & 28 \\
Albuquerque & 2012 & 14.2 & 23 \\
\hline
New York & 2009 & 4.1 & 30 \\
New York & 2012 & 3.8 & 36 \\
\hline
Pittsburgh & 2009 &  18.6 & 33 \\
Pittsburgh & 2012 &  12.6 & 38 \\
\hline
San Francisco & 2009 & 6.1 & 20 \\
San Francisco & 2012 & 7.4 & 28 \\
\hline
Detroit & 2009 & 43.8 &  31  \\
Detroit & 2012 & 47.6 &  28  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}


## Data must not be in wide format!

\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Murder Rate 2009} & \textbf{Police 2009} & \textbf{Murder Rate 2012} & \textbf{Police 2012} \\
\hline
Baltimore      & 55.4 & 42 & 47.4 & 49 \\
Albuquerque    & 7.7  & 28 & 14.2 & 23 \\
New York       & 4.1  & 30 & 3.8  & 36 \\
Pittsburgh     & 18.6 & 33 & 12.6 & 38 \\
San Francisco  & 6.1  & 20 & 7.4  & 28 \\
Detroit        & 43.8 & 31 & 47.6 & 28 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Can't work with that! If you have such data, use the `pivot` commands from `dplyr` to bring your panel data into long form.


## Difference-in-Differences: a Quasi-Experimental Design

\brf{Some units get treated, some don't}... we've heard that before

\vfill
\brf{What's different about difference-in-differences?}

- **Treatment assignment** does **NOT** need to be as good as **random**
- The **TREND in outcomes** of the control group is a good **counterfactual** for the trend of the treated group

\vfill
DiD is arguably one of the \brf{most popular designs in empirical economics}

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "johnsnowpub.jpeg"))

## The Cholera Hypothesis

Snow's theory: \brf{Cholera is transmitted through water}

- People drink contaminated water that contains the cholera bacterium
- The bacterium enters the digestive system and causes cholera
- Through vomiting and diarrhea, the bacterium is excreted and contaminates the water supply further

\vfill
**Some observations**:

- Sailors got sick when they went on land but not when staying docked
- Cholera was more prevalent in poor areas with bad hygiene
- Some apartment blocks were affected, other neighbouring ones not


## The Cholera Hypothesis

\brf{How could Snow test his theory?}

- Mind you: experiments were only established in 1935 by Fisher as a means to prove causality
- And you couldn't run an experiment (drink from the Thames if heads, from another source if tails)

\vfill

\brf{Snow's research design}

- Some areas in London had their water supply from the Thames
- Others had their water supply from other sources
- Problem: areas were different in many ways


## Snow's Research Design

\brf{Different boroughs in London} had different \brf{water supplies, all from the Thames}

\vfill

\brf{But: in 1849 the Lambeth Water Company switched to a new water source upstream}

- This turned out to be cleaner and not contaminated cholera
- The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company did not switch

\vfill
\brf{Did cholera cases decline in Lambeth after the switch relative to Southwark and Vauxhall?}



## Lambeth vs. Southwark and Vauxhall Water Supply

## John Snow's Data

Much of the data on water suppliers was hand-collected (!) by Snow

\vfill
\brf{Cholera deaths per 10,000 households} in the mid-1850s
\begin{tabular}{lcc}
\hline
\textbf{Company Name} & \textbf{1849} & \textbf{1854} \\
& Before Switch & After Switch \\
\hline
Southwark and Vauxhall & 135 & 147 \\
Lambeth & 85 & 19 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\vfill
\brf{Things to note}

- There were **more deaths in both years in Southwark and Vauxhall**
- **Death rates in Lambeth dropped dramatically** after the switch
- Death rates in Southwark and Vauxhall stayed roughly the same
