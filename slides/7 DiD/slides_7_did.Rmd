## Fixed Effects

Start with a regression:

$$ Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i} + u_{i} $$ \vfill If there are unobserved confounders, we have the problem that $E[u_i|X_i] \neq 0$

\vfill

If we could \brf{observe these confounders}, we could include them in the regression

$$ Y_{i} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i} +  \boldsymbol{S_{i}'\delta} + u_{i} $$ If $S_{i}$ includes all confounders, $E[u_i|X_i, \boldsymbol{S_i}]=0$ holds and we have an unbiased and consistent estimator for $\beta_1$.

## Fixed Effects: Controlling for Unobservables

\brf{Problem}: We usually can't observe all confounders

\vfill

\brf{Fixed effects} allow us to \brf{control for (some) unobserved and observed confounders}

\vfill
\brf{What we need:}

-   **Panel data**: multiple observations per unit
-   or **Grouped data**: multiple units in each group

## Fixed Effects with Panel Data

\brf{Panel data} is data with multiple observations per unit $i$

$$ Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + u_{it} $$ \vfill

Now \brf{add unit fixed effects}:

$$ Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \alpha_i + u_{it} $$

The fixed effects $\alpha_i$ can be viewed as \brf{separate dummies for each unit $i$}

## What Fixed Effects Do

$$ Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{it} + \alpha_i + u_{it} $$

The fixed effects $\alpha_i$ isolate the \brf{within-unit variation in $Y_{it}$ and $X_{it}$}

\vfill

Suppose $i$ are countries and $t$ are years. \brf{Interpretation of $\beta_1$}:

-   If $X_{it}$ goes up in a given country, how does $Y_{it}$ change within the same country?
-   So $\beta_1$ measures the \brf{average within-country effect} of $X_{it}$ on $Y_{it}$

\vfill

The fixed effects $\alpha_i$ \brf{control for all time-invariant observables AND unobservables}

## Fixed Effects: Example

We will now go through a simple example: \brf{crime rates and police presence in cities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Here, a \textit{group} is a city
\item There is \textit{within-city variation} in crime rates and police presence \textit{over time}
\item This is the classic use of \textit{fixed effects with panel data}
\end{itemize}

\vfill

Data are (to some extent) made up for illustration purposes

## Fixed Effects: Example

\brf{Causal relationship of interest}

\begin{equation*}
    \mbox{crime}_{i}=\alpha + \beta \mbox{ police presence}_{i} + u_i
\end{equation*}

\vfill

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Year} & \textbf{Murder rate} & \textbf{Police presence} \\
\hline
Baltimore  & 2009 & 55.4 & 42  \\
Albuquerque & 2009 & 7.7 & 28 \\
New York & 2009 & 4.1 & 30 \\
Pittsburgh & 2009 &  18.6 & 33 \\
San Francisco & 2009 & 6.1 & 20 \\
Detroit & 2009 & 43.8 &  31  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

## The Cross-sectional Relationship is Positive...

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph1.png"))
```

## Fixed Effect Regressions

\brf{Logic of Fixed Effect Regressions}: exploit \textbf{variation within subjects over time} \vfill

In our case: how does the \textbf{murder rate in a city change} when \underline{in the same city} the police presence increases by 1 unit? \vfill \textbf{Advantage:}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{fixed city characteristics} are \textbf{held constant}
  \item And as such many determinants why Baltimore has a higher crime rate \textit{and} police presence than San Francisco
  \item We circumvent an important \textit{selection problem} $\Rightarrow$ eliminates (or reduces) \textbf{omitted variable bias}
\end{itemize}

## Now Suppose You Have Panel Data

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Year} & \textbf{Murder rate} & \textbf{Police presence} \\
\hline
Baltimore  & 2009 & 55.4 & 42  \\
Baltimore  & 2012 & 47.4 & 49  \\
\hline
Albuquerque & 2009 & 7.7 & 28 \\
Albuquerque & 2012 & 14.2 & 23 \\
\hline
New York & 2009 & 4.1 & 30 \\
New York & 2012 & 3.8 & 36 \\
\hline
Pittsburgh & 2009 &  18.6 & 33 \\
Pittsburgh & 2012 &  12.6 & 38 \\
\hline
San Francisco & 2009 & 6.1 & 20 \\
San Francisco & 2012 & 7.4 & 28 \\
\hline
Detroit & 2009 & 43.8 &  31  \\
Detroit & 2012 & 47.6 &  28  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\scriptsize{Note: data are fictitious}

## Cross-sectional Relationship in Panel Data: Still Positive

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph2.png"))
```

## In each year we have a positive association

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph3.png"))
```

## Now look at within-city changes

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph4.png"))
```

## Fixed Effect Regressions

A \textbf{Fixed Effect Regressions} only relies on the \textbf{within-variation}

\begin{equation*}
    Y_{it} = \beta X_{it} + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it}
\end{equation*}\
\vfill The \textbf{between-variation} will be netted out \vfill At the core of the FE regression lies a \textbf{within-transformation} \begin{equation*}
    Y_{it}-\overline{Y}_i = \beta(X_{it}-\overline{X}_i) + \varepsilon_{it} - \varepsilon_{i}
\end{equation*} \vfill Takes from each variable the \textbf{deviation from the mean}

## Within-transformation of $Y$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph5.png"))
```

## Within-transformation of $X$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph6.png"))
```

## Within-transformation of $X$ and $Y$

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph7.png"))
```

## The within-effects in each city

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph8.png"))
```

## Average within-effect: NEGATIVE!

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fe_graph9.png"))
```

## Summary of the example

The \textbf{cross-sectional relationship} between police presence and crime rates is \textbf{positive}

-   This is \textbf{between-city variation}
-   It is driven by \textbf{differences in city characteristics}
-   More crime-prone cities choose to hire more police officers...

\vfill

We can learn a lot from \textbf{within-city variation}

-   The city fixed effects \textbf{eliminate all time-invariant differences between cities}
-   They isolate the \textbf{within-city variation} in \textbf{all variables}
-   The \textbf{within-effect} of police presence on crime rates is \textbf{negative}

\vfill

\brf{Interpretation:} if within a city the police presence goes up by 1 unit, the crime rate goes down by $\beta$ units

## Another way to look at fixed effects

The fixed effects \brf{split the data into many units} -- here a unit is a city

\vfill

A \brf{fixed effect regression performs two tasks} at the same time:

1.  it estimates the effect of X on Y within each unit
2.  it averages these effects across all units

## Fixed Effects and Causality

Fixed effects can \brf{eliminate time-invariant confounders}

$$ Y_{it} = \beta X_{it} + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$

\vfill

Causal identification is through \brf{selection on observables}

\vfill
\brf{Conditional independence assumption}

$$ E[\varepsilon_{it}|X_{it}, \alpha_i] = 0 $$

-   Conditional on fixed effects, the error term is uncorrelated with $X_{it}$
-   In plain English: **within each unit,** $X_{it}$ has to be as good as randomly assigned

## Multiple units and time periods

It is common to have \brf{panel data with many units and many time periods}

-   Example: 50 US states over 20 years

\vfill

We often use \brf{two-way fixed effects}:

-   Unit fixed effects ($\delta_i$) absorb all time-invariant differences between units
-   Time fixed effects ($\delta_t$) absorb all time trends that are common to all units

\vfill

The \brf{regression equation is then}

$$ Y_{it} = \beta X_{it} + \delta_i + \delta_t + u_{it} $$

## Fixed Effects with Grouped Data

\brf{Grouped data} is data with multiple units $i=1,\dots,N$ which belong to distinct groups $g=1,\dots,G$.

\vfill

\brf{Example:} students in schools, workers in firms, patients in hospitals

\vfill

\brf{Classic case}: stratified experiments in within schools

-   It is not random who goes to which school
-   But within schools, treatment assignment is random

\vfill

To estimate the treatment effect, we can use \brf{fixed effects for groups}

\begin{equation*}
    Y_{ig} = \beta X_{ig} + \alpha_g + u_{ig}
\end{equation*}

## Example for Identification with Group Fixed Effects: Project STAR

Remember the STAR experiment? Within schools, students were randomly assigned to small classes

-   It is not random who goes to which school
-   But it is random who gets assigned to small classes within a given school

\vfill

The \brf{basic regression} run by \citet{krueger_1999} was

$$ \text{Test score}_{ig} = \beta \; 1[\text{Small class}]_{ig} + \alpha_g + \varepsilon_{ig} $$ \vfill $\beta$ is \brf{causally identified because of the random assignment} within schools

## Implementation of Fixed Effects Regressions in R

First of all, you need to \brf{have panel data in "long form"}

-   Each \textbf{row} is an observation for a unit at a certain time

\small

\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Year} & \textbf{Murder rate} & \textbf{Police presence} \\
\hline
Baltimore  & 2009 & 55.4 & 42  \\
Baltimore  & 2012 & 47.4 & 49  \\
\hline
Albuquerque & 2009 & 7.7 & 28 \\
Albuquerque & 2012 & 14.2 & 23 \\
\hline
New York & 2009 & 4.1 & 30 \\
New York & 2012 & 3.8 & 36 \\
\hline
Pittsburgh & 2009 &  18.6 & 33 \\
Pittsburgh & 2012 &  12.6 & 38 \\
\hline
San Francisco & 2009 & 6.1 & 20 \\
San Francisco & 2012 & 7.4 & 28 \\
\hline
Detroit & 2009 & 43.8 &  31  \\
Detroit & 2012 & 47.6 &  28  \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

## Data must not be in wide format!

\footnotesize
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|r|r|}
\hline
\textbf{City} & \textbf{Murder Rate 2009} & \textbf{Police 2009} & \textbf{Murder Rate 2012} & \textbf{Police 2012} \\
\hline
Baltimore      & 55.4 & 42 & 47.4 & 49 \\
Albuquerque    & 7.7  & 28 & 14.2 & 23 \\
New York       & 4.1  & 30 & 3.8  & 36 \\
Pittsburgh     & 18.6 & 33 & 12.6 & 38 \\
San Francisco  & 6.1  & 20 & 7.4  & 28 \\
Detroit        & 43.8 & 31 & 47.6 & 28 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\vfill

Can't work with that! If you have such data, use the `pivot` commands from `dplyr` to bring your panel data into long form.

## Fixed Effects in R: Preparation

You can use different **R packages to run fixed effect regressions**:

-   Use the standard `lm()` and include dummies for units or groups
-   Use the `plm` package (`plm()` with the `within` option)
-   Use the `fixest` package, which is very efficient, especially when you have many fixed effects

\vfill

For `plm` and `fixest` and other advanced packages, we need `modelsummary` to display the results

\vfill

We will showcase these methods with the `gapminder` data

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
library(plm)
library(fixest)
library(modelsummary)
```

## The Gapminder Data: 142 countries, 12 years

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
data("gapminder")
head(gapminder)
```

## OLS Regressions with Dummies

Suppose we want to regress life expectancy on GDP per capita

-   We want to include 141 country dummies and 11 year dummies
-   We can do this easily with `factor()`

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Generate log gdp per capita
gapminder$loggdp <- log(gapminder$gdpPercap)

# Plain OLS without dummies
fereg.ols <- lm(lifeExp ~ loggdp, data = gapminder)

# Estimate OLS with country and year dummies
fereg.olsdummies <- lm(lifeExp ~ loggdp + factor(country) + factor(year)
                       , data = gapminder)
```

## OLS vs Fixed Effects (dummies)

\footnotesize

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
stargazer(fereg.ols, fereg.olsdummies, 
          column.labels = c("OLS", "OLS dummies"),
          type = "latex", header = FALSE, digits = 2,
          keep= "loggdp",
          keep.stat = c("n", "adj.rsq"))
```

## `plm` and `fixest`

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# Convert your data frame to a pdata.frame for plm
pdata <- pdata.frame(gapminder, index = c("country", "year"))
pdata$loggdp <- log(pdata$gdpPercap)

# FE estimation with PLM (note: the effect argument is important here)
fereg.plm <- plm(lifeExp ~ loggdp, data = pdata, 
                 model = "within", effect="twoways")

# FE estimation with fixest (LOOK HOW SIMPLE!)
fereg.fixest <- feols(lifeExp ~ loggdp | 
                        country + year, data = gapminder)

```

## Regression results

\footnotesize

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
model_list <- list("OLS"=fereg.ols, 
                   "OLS dummies"=fereg.olsdummies, 
                   "PLM"=fereg.plm, 
                   "FIXEST"=fereg.fixest)

# Use modelsummary to create the table
msummary(model_list, output = "latex", 
         keep = "loggdp",
         gof_omit = "^(?!.*Num.Obs|.*R2.Adj)")
```

## Regression results

All regressions that account for fixed effects yield the **same point estimates**

\vfill

The **standard errors differ**:

-   OLS and `plm` do not adjust the standard errors unless we tell them to do so
-   `fixest` adjusts the standard errors, in this case for two-way clustering at the country and year level
-   Neither is 100% correct! Consensus is to cluster by unit but not time

\vfill

Why do we \brf{need to adjust the standard errors?}

-   Observations within the same unit are likely to be correlated
-   Life expectancy today is a function of life expectancy yesterday, and so on

## (One reason) Why we need Differences-in-Differences

\brf{Consider the fixed effect regression} with states $i$ and time periods $t$

$$ Y_{it} = \beta X_{it} + \alpha_i + \varepsilon_{it} $$ \vfill \brf{Suppose $X_{it}$ is a policy variable}: in some period $t$, a new policy is introduced in some states

-   $X_{it}$ could be a dummy that equals one in each period after the policy has been introduced

\vfill

We can't really argue that the \brf{policy change was as good as random}

-   There are probably **good reasons why a policy was introduced** in state $i$ and why at time $t$

## Difference-in-Differences: a Quasi-Experimental Design

\brf{Some units get treated, some don't}... we've heard that before

\vfill
\brf{What's different about difference-in-differences?}

-   **Treatment assignment** does **NOT** need to be as good as **random**
-   The **TREND in outcomes** of the control group is a good **counterfactual** for the trend of the treated group

\vfill

DiD is arguably one of the \brf{most popular designs in empirical economics}

(Source: Wikipedia)

## The Cholera Hypothesis

Snow's theory: \brf{Cholera is transmitted through water}

-   People drink contaminated water that contains the cholera bacterium
-   The bacterium enters the digestive system and causes cholera
-   Through vomiting and diarrhea, the bacterium is excreted and contaminates the water supply further

\vfill

**Some observations**:

-   Sailors got sick when they went on land but not when staying docked
-   Cholera was more prevalent in poor areas with bad hygiene
-   Some apartment blocks were affected, other neighbouring ones not

## The Cholera Hypothesis

\brf{How could Snow test his theory?}

-   Mind you: experiments were only established in 1935 by Fisher as a means to prove causality
-   And you couldn't run an experiment (drink from the Thames if heads, from another source if tails)

\vfill

\brf{Snow's research design}

-   Some areas in London had their water supply from the Thames
-   Others had their water supply from other sources
-   Problem: areas were different in many ways

## Snow's Research Design

\brf{Different boroughs in London} had different \brf{water supplies, all from the Thames}

\vfill

\brf{But: in 1849 the Lambeth Water Company switched to a new water source upstream}

-   This turned out to be cleaner and not contaminated cholera
-   The Southwark and Vauxhall Water Company did not switch

\vfill
\brf{Did cholera cases decline in Lambeth after the switch relative to Southwark and Vauxhall?}

\brf{Difference 1}: Lambeth vs. Southwark and Vauxhall

-   Solid blue vs red line: differences in cholera deaths between the two areas

\vfill

\brf{Difference 2}: Before vs. after the switch

-   Dotted blue line: projects the trend in Lambeth if the switch had not happened
-   This is just the trend of Southwark and Vauxhall

\vfill

\brf{Difference-in-differences}: The difference between the solid and dotted blue line

-   relative to the counterfactual, the switch reduced cholera deaths by 78 per 10,000 households

\vfill

The difference-in-differences is 78 cholera deaths per 10,000 households

-   Because of the switch, cholera deaths dropped by 78 per 10,000 households in Lambeth

## The simple $2 \times 2$ DiD

The simple $2 \times 2$ DiD is the \brf{canonical difference-in-differences design}

-   We have the difference between a **treatment group** $k$ and an untreated group $U$
-   ...and the difference before and after $k$ received the treatment ($pre(k)$, $post(k)$)

$$\widehat{\delta}^{2\times 2}_{kU} = \underbrace{\bigg ( \overline{y}_k^{\post(k)} - \overline{y}_k^{\pre(k)} \bigg )}_{\text{Pre-post difference, treated}} - \underbrace{\bigg ( \overline{y}_U^{\post(k)} - \overline{y}_U^{\pre(k)} \bigg )}_{\text{Pre-post difference, untreated}}$$

\vfill

$\widehat{\delta}^{2\times 2}_{kU}$ is the estimated ATT for group $k$

## What does the simple $2 \times 2$ DiD identify?

Start with \brf{conditional expectations}

$$\widehat{\delta}^{2\times 2}_{kU} = \bigg(E\big[Y_k  \Mid \Post\big] - E\big[Y_k  \Mid\Pre\big]\bigg)- \bigg(E\big[Y_U  \Mid \Post\big] - E\big[Y_U  \Mid \Pre\big]\bigg)$$

\vfill

Let's use \brf{potential outcomes} and add and \brf{subtract a counterfactual}

\begin{align*}
&\widehat{\delta}^{2\times 2}_{kU} = \bigg ( \underbrace{E\big[Y^1_k  \Mid \Post\big] - E\big[Y^0_k  \Mid \Pre\big] \bigg ) - \bigg(E\big[Y^0_U  \Mid \Post\big] - E\big[ Y^0_U  \Mid\Pre\big]}_{\text{Switching equation}} \bigg) \\
&+ \underbrace{E\big[Y_k^0  \Mid\Post\big] - E\big[Y^0_k  \Mid \Post\big]}_{\text{Adding and subtracting the counterfactual}} 
\end{align*}

## What does the simple $2 \times 2$ DiD identify?

Re-arrange the terms from the previous slide:

\begin{align*}
&\widehat{\delta}^{2\times 2}_{kU} = \underbrace{E\big[Y^1_k \Mid\Post\big] - E\big[Y^0_k \Mid \Post\big]}_{\text{ATT}} \\
&+\Big[\underbrace{E\big[Y^0_k \Mid \Post\big] - E\big[Y^0_k \Mid\Pre\big] \Big] - \Big[E\big[Y^0_U \Mid\Post\big] - E\big[Y_U^0 \Mid\Pre\big] }_{\text{Non-parallel trends bias in $2\times 2$ case}} \Big]
\end{align*}

\vfill

The simple $2 \times 2$ DiD identifies the \brf{average treatment effect on the treated (ATT)}

-   but only if the second term is zero...
-   that is, only if the \brf{parallel trends assumption} holds

## The parallel trends assumption

Notice here: $Y^0$ appears everywhere $\Rightarrow$ \brf{counterfactual!}

$$\Big[\underbrace{E\big[Y^0_k \Mid \Post\big] - E\big[Y^0_k \Mid\Pre\big] \Big] - \Big[E\big[Y^0_U \Mid\Post\big] - E\big[Y_U^0 \Mid\Pre\big] }_{\text{Non-parallel trends bias in $2\times 2$ case}} \Big]$$

In plain English: \brf{in the absence of the treatment}, the outcomes of the treated and untreated groups would have \brf{evolved in the same way}

## Classic Study: \citet{card_1994} on the Effects of Minimum Wages

Economic theory: \brf{higher minimum wages}...

-   **reduce employment** in **competitive labour markets**
-   but it may **increase employment in monopsonistic labour markets**

\vfill

Which model is correct in practice? That's an empirical question

\vfill

In a controversial study, \citet{card_1994} use the minimum wage increase in New Jersey in 1992 to answer this question

-   They use data on workers in fast food restaurants
-   They use Pennsylvania as a control state, which did not change its minimum wage

## Classic Study: \citet{card_1994} on the Effects of Minimum Wages

In 1992, New Jersey increased the minimum wage, while Pennsylvania did not

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "95%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "card1.pdf"))
```

## The minimum wage change did bite

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "55%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "cardkrueger1.jpg"))
```

## The $2 \times 2$ DiD in \citet{card_1994}

\brf{ATT} of interest: \begin{align*}
&\widehat{\delta}^{2\times 2}_{NJ,PA} = \underbrace{E\big[Y^1_{NJ} \mathop{\mathrm{\,\vert\,}}\mathop{\mathrm{Post}}\big] - E\big[Y^0_{NJ} \mathop{\mathrm{\,\vert\,}}\mathop{\mathrm{Post}}\big]}_{\text{ATT}} \\
&+ \Big[\underbrace{E\big[Y^0_{NJ} \mathop{\mathrm{\,\vert\,}}\mathop{\mathrm{Post}}\big] - E\big[Y^0_{NJ} \mathop{\mathrm{\,\vert\,}}\mathop{\mathrm{Pre}}\big] \Big]-\Big[E\big[Y^0_{PA} \mathop{\mathrm{\,\vert\,}}\mathop{\mathrm{Post}}\big] - E\big[Y_{PA}^0 \mathop{\mathrm{\,\vert\,}}\mathop{\mathrm{Pre}}\big] }_{\text{Non-parallel trends bias}} \Big]
\end{align*} \vfill With \textbf{constant state and time effects}, this \textbf{maps into the regression} \begin{equation*}
Y_{its} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda D_t + \delta (NJ \times D)_{st} + \varepsilon_{its}
\end{equation*}

## The $2 \times 2$ DiD in \citet{card_1994}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "60%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "card3.png"))
```

Does $\widehat{\delta}^{2\times 2}_{NJ,PA}=2.76$ mean that the minimum wage raised employment?

## The $2 \times 2$ DiD in \citet{card_1994}

\begin{equation*}
Y_{its} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda D_t + \delta (NJ \times D)_{st} + \varepsilon_{its}
\end{equation*}

\vfill

1.  PA pre: $\alpha$
2.  PA post: $\alpha + \lambda$
3.  NJ pre: $\alpha + \gamma$
4.  NJ post: $\alpha + \gamma + \lambda + \delta$

\vfill

$\delta$ is the \brf{difference-in-differences} estimator!

## The ATT in \citet{card_1994}

\begin{equation*}
Y_{its} = \alpha + \gamma NJ_s + \lambda D_t + \delta (NJ \times D)_{st} + \varepsilon_{its}
\end{equation*}

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "fig-dd-diagram-1.png"))
```

## Providing Evidence for Parallel Trends

We want to \brf{estimate the ATT} but there might be a \brf{non-parallel trends bias}

$$\Big[\underbrace{E\big[Y^0_k \Mid \Post\big] - E\big[Y^0_k \Mid\Pre\big] \Big] - \Big[E\big[Y^0_U \Mid\Post\big] - E\big[Y_U^0 \Mid\Pre\big] }_{\text{Non-parallel trends bias in $2\times 2$ case}} \Big]$$

\vfill

\brf{The Parallel Trends Assumption} is an \brf{identification assumption}

-   Identification assumptions **cannot be tested!**
-   We need to **bring good arguments in favour** of it (difficult)
-   And provide **empirical evidence in support** of it (easy?)

## Providing Evidence for Parallel Trends: Pre-trends

A common \brf{diagnostics test} is to look at the \brf{pre-trends}

-   Suppose treated and control **moved in parallel before** the treatment was given
-   ...it is then likely they **would have moved in parallel after**, had the **treatment not been given**

\vfill

\brf{Pre-trends} are commonly presented in \brf{event-study graphs}

## Event Study Example: \citet{miller_2021}

\citet{miller_2021} study the impact of the expansion of Medicaid in the U.S. on population mortality

\vfill

\brf{Expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act (ACA)} in 2014

-   Health insurance for low-income individuals
-   Post-2014: covers everyone with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line
-   Initially, the ACA was supposed to apply to all states
-   But the Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that states could opt out
-   29 states plus DC expanded Medicaid in 2014, 7 later, 14 did not

\vfill

Data: \brf{Vital statistics data} on deaths linked with individual survey data

## Event Study Example: \citet{miller_2021}

\brf{Difference-in-differences}:

-   Expansion states vs. non-expansion states
-   After vs. before the expansion
-   But: "staggered adoption" because there were states that expanded Medicaid later

\vfill

\brf{Event studies} consider leads (pre-treatment) and lags (post-treatment) of the treatment date

-   The treatment date is the date of the Medicaid expansion
-   It is normalised to $t=0$
-   Leads are $\tau=-1, -2, -3, -4, -5, ...$
-   Lags are $\tau=1, 2, 3, 4, 5,...$

## Event Study Example: \citet{miller_2021}

\brf{Event study model} with $q$ leads and $m$ lags

$$Y_{its} = \gamma_s + \lambda_t + \sum_{\tau=-q}^{-1}\gamma_{\tau}D_{s\tau} + \sum_{\tau=0}^m\delta_{\tau}D_{s\tau}+x_{ist}+ \varepsilon_{ist}$$

-   Individuals $i$, states $s$, years $t$
-   $\gamma_s$ state fixed effects, $\lambda_t$ year fixed effects
-   $x_{ist}$ are time-varying controls

## Event Study Example: \citet{miller_2021}

"Zero Stage": Medicaid expansion increased eligibility

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "Miller_Medicaid1.png"))
```

## Event Study Example: \citet{miller_2021}

"First Stage I": Medicaid expansion increased coverage

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "Miller_Medicaid2.png"))
```

## Event Study Example: \citet{miller_2021}

"First Stage II": Medicaid expansion reduced the number of uninsured persons

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "65%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "Miller_Medicaid3.png"))
```

## Event Study Example: \citet{miller_2021}

"Reduced Form": Medicaid expansion reduced mortality by about 9%

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(graphdir, "Miller_Medicaid4.png"))
```

## Lessons from \citet{miller_2021}

\brf{Do parallel trends hold} in the Medicaid expansion case?

-   We don't know!

\vfill

But the **authors provide very compelling evidence**

-   The coefficients of the leads are close to zero and statistically insignificant
-   The coefficients of the lags are large and statistically significant
-   This jump is consistent with the Medicaid expansion and inconsistent with other events

\vfill
\brf{Coefficients of leads are placebo tests}

-   The coefficients are zero when they should be zero

## DiD Example: \citet{marie2017}

Research question: Does (legal) \brf{access to cannabis affect academic performance?}

\vfill

\brf{Difficult to answer because of endogeneity}

-   **People who use cannabis** might be **different from those who don't**

\vfill

\citet{marie2017} exploit a \brf{policy change in Maastricht (NL) in 2011}

## Situtation in the Netherlands

\brf{Cannabis is legal in the Netherlands}, sold in "coffee shops"

\vfill

Maastricht is a border town with Belgium and Germany

\vfill

Over the years, Maastricht became a destination for "cannabis tourism" from abroad

## Policy change in 2011

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.7\textwidth}
In 2011, the Maastricht Association of Cannabis Shop Owners introduced a \brf{new policy}

\vfill
\begin{itemize}
\item Only \textbf{certain nationalities were allowed to buy cannabis} in coffee shops
\item Only \textbf{Dutch, German, and Belgian} nationals were allowed to buy cannabis
\item Other nationalities were not allowed to buy cannabis legally
\item The policy was revoked 7 months later
\end{itemize}
\end{column}

## Difference-in-Differences in \citet{marie2017}

Treated: \brf{non-Dutch/German/Belgian students} in Maastricht Untreated: \brf{Dutch/German/Belgian students} in Maastricht

\vfill

\brf{Outcome}: \brf{academic performance} measured by \brf{grades}

-   Business and economics undergraduate students

## What makes this study great?

Interesting research question

\vfill

Clever identification strategy

\vfill

Good data

\vfill

You can see the DiD in the raw data $\rightarrow$ very convincing!

## Summary: Difference-in-Differences

\brf{Difference-in-differences} is a \brf{quasi-experimental design}

-   It is **very popular for policy evaluation**
-   It is **not necessary for the treatment** assignment to be **as good as random**
-   All we need are **parallel trends**

\vfill

This \brf{lecture is an introduction to DiD}

-   For more advanced topics, see the Mixtape and my YouTube videos

## DiD in R

First example is for a simple DiD from "The Effect"

-   In 2011, California changed organ donations from "opt in" to "opt out"
-   Let's estimate a DiD with California after 2012 being treated

\vfill

We will use the `fixest` package for this simple application. For more complex DiD models, the `did` package by some of the best in the field -- Brantly Callaway and Pedro Sant'Anna -- is more useful.

## DiD in R with `fixest`

```{r did1, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse); library(modelsummary); library(fixest)
od <- causaldata::organ_donations

# Treatment variable
od <- od %>%
     mutate(Treated = State == 'California' & 
            Quarter %in% c('Q32011','Q42011','Q12012'))

# feols clusters by the first fixed effect by default, 
# no adjustment necessary
clfe <- feols(Rate ~ Treated | State + Quarter,
           data = od)
```

## DiD in R with `fixest`

\footnotesize

```{r did2, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
msummary(clfe, stars = c('*' = .1, '**' = .05, '***' = .01))
```

## DiD in R with the `did` Package

Example: minimum wages and teen employment; using state-level changes in minimum wages

```{r did3, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
  library(did)
  data(mpdta)
```

\begin{tabular}{ll}
lemp & outcome: log of county-level teen employment \\
first.treat & period when a state first increased the minimum wage \\
year & time variable \\
countyreal & unit variable
\end{tabular}

## DiD in R with the `did` Package

```{r did4, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
out <- att_gt(yname = "lemp",
              gname = "first.treat",
              idname = "countyreal",
              tname = "year",
              xformla = ~1,
              data = mpdta,
              est_method = "reg"
              )
```

## DiD in R with the `did` Package

\scriptsize

```{r did5, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
msummary(out)
```

## Event study in R with the `did` Package

```{r did6, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE, include=TRUE}
es <- aggte(out, type = "dynamic")
msummary(es)
